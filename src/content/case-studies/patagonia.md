Patagonia is a family-owned apparel and outdoor sporting goods outfitter, rooted in sustainability. As a leader in eco-friendly business models, they’ve paved the way for others to reimagine their practices with sustainability in mind.

For Patagonia’s flagship experience, we were tasked with crafting a design solution that brought its massive product and content library to life in a simple yet insightful way. For a brand that truly lives it’s values, it was vital that the user experience echo that—meaning that our challenge was to create a digital shopping experience that tells a brand story at every touchpoint.
