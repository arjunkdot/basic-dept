The 27th Annual Webby Awards is shaping up to be our biggest year yet. With a record-breaking 19 nominations and 9 honorees, we’re in the running for Webbys Agency of the Year. And we’re ready to take the title home.

We’re thrilled to be recognized this year for some of our most recent collaborations, including B/D® JAMS, Google Chrome OS, Lululemon Studio, Jeff Koons and Webex. And we’re honored that seasoned veterans Patagonia, Crafted, Cowboy, and Google Store are still nominated year after year to defend their winning titles.
