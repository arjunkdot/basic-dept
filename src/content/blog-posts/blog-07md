At BASIC/DEPT®, we shared in many events this Women’s History Month that created space for women, by women; our Director of People and Culture, Jonelle Roman, led a network-wide panel alongside two other women about how to create a more gender-equitable space within the digital realm and tech industry; internally, our DE&I team hosted a virtual talk with Sister League of San Diego, a women’s non-profit focused on providing housing and skills growth for women in need (volunteer talks are in the works).
